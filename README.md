## üìñ Project Overview

Quick Aid is a smart accident detection system designed to **reduce response time** and provide **instant first aid** by alerting authorities and emergency contacts.

The system uses data from onboard sensors (**accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS**) and **machine learning models** to detect accidents and automatically notify emergency services and pre-configured contacts with the user‚Äôs location.

‚ú® **Goal:** Ensure a safer commute ‚Äî especially for motorcyclists in high-traffic areas ‚Äî and reduce permanent disabilities and fatalities by **speeding up emergency response**.


## üî¨ Research Work

## üîç How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Device attached to the vehicle collects accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Sensor signals are filtered, segmented, and features are extracted (time & frequency domain).  
3. **Modeling:** Trained ML models classify whether a segment indicates an accident. Supported models:  
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
   - K-Means (anomaly detection / clustering)  
   - Deep Learning (CNN/LSTM for temporal patterns)  
   - Logistic Regression (baseline)  
4. **Decision & Alerting:** On detection, the system sends an alert (with GPS coordinates) to emergency contacts and authorities and triggers mobile app notifications.  


## üì± Mobile App Features

- Register & manage user profile.  
- Add / manage emergency contacts and devices.  
- Receive live notifications and alert history.  
- Share real-time GPS location with emergency responders.
